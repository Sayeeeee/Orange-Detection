# Orange-Detection-using-Jetson-Nano-2GB
## AIM AND OBJECTIVES
## AIM
To create a classification system which detects the quality of a Orange and specifies whether the given Orange is rotten or not.
OBJECTIVES
• The main objective of the project is to do quality check of a given Orange within a short period of time.
• Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.
• To show on the optical viewfinder of the camera module whether a Orange is rotten or not.

## ABSTRACT
• A Orange can be classified based on it’s quality and then specified whether it is rotten or not on the live feed of the system’s camera.
• A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another.
Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.
• One such technique is to use Resnet Net-50 model with Keras, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.
• Huge post–harvest losses are caused because of poor handling while shipping oranges, because of which oranges sometimes gets crushed and hence develops black spots
which further increases the process of rot.

## INTRODUCTION
• This project is based on Oranges detection model. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning.
• This project can also be used to gather information about the quality of Oranges like whether they are rotten or not.
• Orange quality can be further classified as raw, slightly raw, ripe, over ripe and rotten.
• Based on which side of Orange appears on the camera’s viewfinder the Orange may appear ripe or rotten hence using multiple cameras or rotation of the Orange is
recommended.
• Today, each and every system is being automated. There is much less human intervention as it is both time consuming and non-economical. For the defect identification
purposes, automated systems are used. The image processing has been widely used for identification, classification and quality evaluation.
• Here a sorting process is introduced where the image of the Orange is captured and analysed using image processing techniques and the defected Orange is discarded by
this process. The main aim is to do the quality check of the Oranges within a short span of time.
• Due to cost and inaccurate process, sorting tons of quality Oranges to produce food products made from Oranges is an another problem that is faced by most of the
agricultural industries.
• Neural networks and machine learning have been used for these tasks and have obtained good results.
• Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for Orange detection as well.
## LITERATURE REVIEW
• Fresh Oranges are an important part of a healthy diet. They contain essential vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients that are essential for good health. In fact, research
has shown that a healthy diet rich in Orange may reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases.
• Oranges are rich in fiber which is very essential for the smooth movement of the digestive system. There are some Oranges that give body energy as they contain
carbohydrates which are the main source of energy. Carbohydrates in Oranges are mainly sugar which actually breaks down easily and make a quick source of energy.
• Antioxidants are essential for human health. These compounds mop up free radicals in the body that can damage the body’s cells and lead to diseases, such as cancers.
Researchers believe that the Oranges contain Trusted Source tryptophan, an amino acid that may help preserve memory, boost a person’s ability to learn and remember things,
and regulate mood.
• As the idiom goes one rotten apple spoils the barrel so does any Orange can also spoil every Orange surrounding it hence finding the rotten ones as fast as possible becomes
absolutely necessary.
• Most fresh Oranges are picked before they are ripe. This allows them time to fully ripen during transportation. It also gives them less time to develop a full range of vitamins,
minerals and natural antioxidants. In the US, Oranges and vegetables may spend anywhere from 3 days to several weeks in transit before arriving at a distribution center.
• During transportation, fresh produce is generally stored in a chilled, controlled atmosphere and treated with chemicals to prevent spoiling. Once they reach the supermarket,
Oranges and vegetables may spend an additional 1–3 days on display. They’re then stored in people’s homes for up to 7 days before being eaten.
• Shortly after harvesting, fresh Oranges start to lose moisture, have a greater risk of spoiling and drop in nutrient value. The vitamin C in fresh Oranges begins to decline
immediately after harvesting and continues to do so during storage.
• Food makes the largest source of waste that goes in municipal landfills and combusted for energy recovery. Many a times the Oranges from vendors or shopkeepers go to
waste because of the Oranges turning rotten because of one Orange that was not taken out early.
## PROPOSED SYSTEM
1] Study basics of machine learning and image recognition.
2] Start with implementation

A. Front-end development
B. Back-end development
3] Testing, analyzing and improvising the model. An application using python IDLE and its machine learning libraries will be using machine learning to identify whether a given
Banana is rotten or not.
4] use datasets to interpret the object and suggest whether a given Orange on the camera’s viewfinder is rotten or not.
Jetson Nano Compatibility
• The power of modern AI is now available for makers, learners, and embedded developers everywhere.
• NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™ Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object
detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts.
• Hence due to ease of process as well as reduced cost of implementation we have used Jetson nano for model detection and training.
• NVIDIA JetPack SDK is the most comprehensive solution for building end-to-end accelerated AI applications. All Jetson modules and developer kits are supported by JetPack
SDK.
• In our model we have used JetPack version 4.6 which is the latest production release and supports all Jetson modules.

## ADVANTAGES
• Orange detection system will be of great help in minimizing the damage that one rotten Orange can do to the entire barrel of Orange.
• Orange detection system shows whether the Orange in view finder of camera module is rotten or not with good accuracy.
• Once a rotten Orange is detected on the camera module the Orange detection model can they convey it to the worker in the shop or plant or if needed this process can be
completely automated to make machines do the work of sorting Orange.
• When completely automated no user input is required and therefore works with absolute efficiency and speed.
• It can work around the clock and therefore becomes more cost efficient.

## APPLICATION
• Detects a Orange and then checks whether the Orange is rotten or not in a given image frame or viewfinder using a camera module.
• Can be used in shops, malls, plants, storage facilities, godowns and at any place where Orange are stored and needs sorting.
• Can be used as a reference for other AI models based on Orange Detection.

## FUTURE SCOPE
• As we know technology is marching towards automation so this project is one of the step towards automation.
• Thus, for more accurate results it needs to be trained for more images, and for a greater number of epochs.
• Orange detection will become a necessity in the future due to rise in population and hence our model will be of great help to tackle the situation of starvation and malnutrition
due to food shortage in an efficient way.

## CONCLUSION
• In this project our model is trying to detect a Orange and then showing it live as to whether Orange is rotten or not. The Orange detection system is used to automate the
segregation of Oranges from rotten ones in an efficient way.
• The model tries to protect the shopkeepers and plant owners from incurring any losses.
• The model is efficient and highly accurate and hence reduces the workforce required.
